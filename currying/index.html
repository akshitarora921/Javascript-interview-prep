    <h2>Currying</h2>
    <pre>Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. 
Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.</pre>
